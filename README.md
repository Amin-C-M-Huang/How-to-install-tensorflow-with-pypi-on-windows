# How-to-install-tensorflow-with-pypi-on-windows
The introduction on the market is generally to install tensorflow on jupyter, which requires the installation of many application suites (for example: cuda, numpy, scipy, cudnn, ....), the introduction here only needs to install the latest version of python that supports Tensorflow, you can run Tensorflow And Tensorflow-gpu, I hope it will help friends who want to try running machine learning on python, let's get started!


Step1. You need to install python.
    You need to go to the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install">Tensorflow</a> official website to confirm the compatible version of Python. The following figure is an example to confirm that the compatible version of Python is 3.7–3.10. Here you can go to the official website of <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a> to download the highest compatible version. Here I downloaded Python 3.9.
